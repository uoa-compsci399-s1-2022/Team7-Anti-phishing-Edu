# Anti-phishing Edu.

![Game Logo](https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s1-2022/Team7-Anti-phishing-Edu/blob/main/Assets/Resources/UI/logo01.png)
A serious game to teach people to thwart phishing attacks.

## Short Description

This repository is the source code and file of Team 7's project, made for Computer Science 399 from the University of Auckland.

The purpose of this game is to educate players to identify and prevent email phishing attacks, so as to protect their own information and property security as much as possible.The gameplay loop is divided into three main parts: story introduction, knowledge learning and testing for different knowledge points. The game establishes a visual user interface, which can simulate phishing emails in reality, so that players can better learn and prevent such attack.

## Project Management

In this project, we have used Notion as our main project management tools. Click the link to check our development process.

## Technology Used

### Tools:

Unity3D - We have used Unity3D 2020.3.31 LTS as our game engine.

### Lanaguages:

C# - C# is the main lanaguage we have used to code our game scripts.

HTML/CSS - HTML helps us to build a website and deploy our game on github page.

## Instructions to install


### For source code:
If you want to check our source code and do not have unity engine, please download Unity from their official website: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download.

For a better compile environment, please download the Long-Term-Support(LTS) version, with the version number: 2020.3.31f

Dependencies are included in our project files.

### For game build:
We offer two ways to play our game, in case one of other failed to load:
1. Visit https://play.unity.com/mg/other/cs399-deloy-build-v2-0 to play on Unity's online server.
2. Visit https://kanericky.github.io/CS399-Deloy-Build/ to play on Github Page.

Link to our build repo: https://github.com/kanericky/CS399-Deloy-Build. Since we need to published our game on Github Page, we put the build file on our tech leader Ruiqi Zhang's personal repository.

## Technology Used

First, we plan to expand the question bank to effectively improve the challenge of the game and increase the replay rate. Based on the modules we developed, even those who do not understand the code can edit and increase the content of the question bank.

Second, emails with wrong answers will be summarised into a wrong question bank, so that players can review their mistakes again, and further educate players not to be phished by phishing.
